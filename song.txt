Listen up, there's not a moment to spare
It's quite a drop from the top, so how you feeling down there?
It’s a cold, cruel, harsh reality
Caught stuck here with your enemies

Who do you think you are
Tearing us all apart?
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It’s twenty to one
Yeah, so you better run

You got the world on its knees
You’re taking all that you please
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
You’re like the burden we bear
