Listen up, there's not a moment to spare
It's quite a drop from the top, so how you feeling down there?
It’s a cold, cruel, harsh reality
Caught stuck here with your enemies

Who do you think you are
Tearing us all apart?
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It’s twenty to one
Yeah, so you better run
